# Monitoring
Here you can find my custom overlays for MSI Afterburner + RTSS.

My current overlay version is RTSS only, which is easy to import and doesn't include any app settings.



## Software

### IMPORTANT NOTE
Monitoring GPU's power (TDP) percentage on NVIDIA cards seem to take a lot of resources, so this metric should be avoided (it is in my monitoring profiles).

### MSI Afterburner (v4.6.6 Beta 5)
Note that some APP config is also included.

### RTSS (v7.3.7 Beta 5)
Only custom overlay is included. It must be imported manually from RTSS > Setup > Plugins > OverlayEditor.dll > Setup > Layots > Load.
Some additional configuration might be needed if your data sources don't match mine.

No v3 RTSS only screenshot is posted since by itself doesn't mean much.

However, my RTSS overlay v4 is a new overlay build for RTSS only from the ground up. Here's how it looks:
